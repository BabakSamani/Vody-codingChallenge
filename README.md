Data
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The data for this api is extracted by using the following source:
``http://www.omdbapi.com/`` 

Set up the API
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For security reasons, an environment file called ``.env`` is setup to store usernames, passwords, API 
keys and etc. 
First you need to setup this file on your server in the same directory of this application. 
The following are the variables that should be in the ``.env`` file:

```bash
MONGO_DB_HOST=
MONGO_DB_PORT=
MONGO_DB_NAME=
MONGO_COLLECTION=

MEDIA_API_URL=http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=<key>&t=<media_title>

HOST_IP=
HOST_PORT=
```
A bash file is written to install required python packages, Mongodb, then get the test data from 
the API and run the server. By running the following command all above processes will be 
automatically executed:

``` bash install_run.sh```

Setup database from backup file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Also, there is a backup for the database that you can run and load the data into the database by 
following command:
```
mongorestore -d <database_name> /data/Vody/
```
